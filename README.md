# Celestial Bodies Database

This project is part of the freeCodeCamp curriculum for the "Relational Database" certification. The Celestial Bodies Database involves creating a database in PostgreSQL to store information about galaxies, stars, planets, and moons.

# Project Description

Exploring the wonders of the universe, this project aims to construct a comprehensive database that captures essential information about celestial bodies. Inspired by the curiosity to unravel the mysteries of space, the Celestial Bodies Database project focuses on structuring data in a way that facilitates organized retrieval and analysis.

Key aspects of the project include:

- Designing a database schema tailored to astronomical data, defining tables with appropriate columns to represent different celestial bodies accurately.
- Implementing relationships between tables using foreign keys to ensure data integrity and consistency.
- Populating the database with celestial information, including attributes such as name, type, distance, and characteristics unique to each body.
- Practicing SQL querying and manipulation techniques to retrieve, filter, and analyze data stored in the database.
